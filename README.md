  ## User Experience (UX)

  ### Initial Discussion

  This website aims to craft a user-led story by providing detailed descriptions of each scene and offering the player choices that can either drive the story forward, change future outcomes by collecting items or end in a game over screen.

  #### Key Areas Covered

    - A website design that reflects the near-future setting of the game.
    - Background images which give the user an idea of the scene they are currently in.
    - A number of choices for the player to make in order to drive the story forward.
        - These will be presented as clickable buttons using Javascript to change to the appropriate scene after clicking.
    - An ending screen (either good or bad) which reflects the player's path through the story and includes a button to restart from the beginning.

## User Stories

- To be able to view the site on a range of device sizes.
